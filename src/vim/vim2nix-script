" Dependencies: you must have the vim2nix vim plugin installed.
"
" Example use:

" of the plugins you want in it (you can fine a list of names
" here: http://vam.mawercer.de/).
"
" 2. From that file (in Vim) run `:source vim2nix-script`.

let opts = {}
let opts.path_to_nixpkgs = '~/code/nixpkgs'
let opts.cache_file = '/tmp/export-vim-plugin-for-nix-cache-file'
let opts.plugin_dictionaries = map(readfile("plugins-to-create"), 'eval(v:val)')
call nix#ExportPluginsForNix(opts)
